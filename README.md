Red Hat速 OpenShift速 is supported Kubernetes for cloud-native applications with enterprise security. Although Kubernetes has great scalability, workload portability and intuitive abstractions which allows you to separate business and developer concerns, it is still quite a concern to install, deploy and keep clusters operational.

Luckily for us developers, there is Minishift - a tool stack we can use locally on our dev machines and develop and test applications for cloud deployment to test/production Red Hat速 OpenShift速 environments.

In this workshop, we will run through a series of scenarios for creating, deploying and managing micro-services within an OpenShift single-node cluster using Minishift.

Pre-requisites:
Before engaging in any of the labs, make sure you have correctly installed Minishift - https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html
